### Overview
Here's a little game I built to demo the [Google+ Hangout API v.1.1's](https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/api/) facility to [track a user's facial coordinates](https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/api/gapi.hangout.av.effects). In this case, I'm monitoring only the position of the bridge of the user's nose. This type of development is insanely fun.
